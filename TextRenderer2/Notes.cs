Certainly! If your goal is to use method chaining as much as possible and fallback to nested functions only when chaining is not feasible, you can design your internal DSL in a way that encourages fluent chaining while still maintaining recursive and flexible behavior. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Steps to Create an Internal DSL Using Method Chaining and Nested Functions

1. **Design a Fluent API**:
   - Use classes where each method returns the same class type to allow fluent chaining.
   - Each method should handle a small, well-defined part of the expression, and return `this` to chain further calls.

2. **Handle Recursive Constructs**:
   - Use nested functions only where chaining would become cumbersome, such as when evaluating recursive parts of the grammar.
   - To deal with deeper recursive parts of a grammar (e.g., nested expressions), use a lambda function as an argument to capture and nest the context.

3. **Create Hierarchy of Builder Classes**:
   - Split the grammar into a hierarchy of classes (e.g., `ExpressionBuilder`, `TermBuilder`, etc.).
   - Each non-terminal grammar rule can be represented by a corresponding builder class.

4. **Fluent Chaining DSL Implementation in C#**:

Below, I'll implement a DSL that models simple arithmetic operations (`expr ::= term | term + expr`) using method chaining for fluent API and nested lambdas for recursive constructs.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text;

public class ExpressionBuilder
{
    private StringBuilder _expression;

    // Constructor initializes the StringBuilder to hold the expression
    public ExpressionBuilder()
    {
        _expression = new StringBuilder();
    }

    // Method for building a term in the expression, supports chaining
    public ExpressionBuilder Term(Func<TermBuilder, TermBuilder> termBuilder)
    {
        var term = new TermBuilder();
        termBuilder(term);
        _expression.Append(term.Build());
        return this;
    }

    // Method for adding an addition operator and the right-hand expression
    public ExpressionBuilder Plus(Func<ExpressionBuilder, ExpressionBuilder> exprBuilder)
    {
        _expression.Append(" + ");
        var expr = new ExpressionBuilder();
        exprBuilder(expr);
        _expression.Append(expr.Build());
        return this;
    }

    // Method to return the final constructed expression
    public string Build()
    {
        return _expression.ToString();
    }
}

public class TermBuilder
{
    private StringBuilder _term;

    // Constructor initializes the StringBuilder to hold the term
    public TermBuilder()
    {
        _term = new StringBuilder();
    }

    // Adds a factor to the term
    public TermBuilder Factor(Func<FactorBuilder, FactorBuilder> factorBuilder)
    {
        var factor = new FactorBuilder();
        factorBuilder(factor);
        _term.Append(factor.Build());
        return this;
    }

    // Method to add a multiplication operator, which allows for further chaining
    public TermBuilder Multiply(Func<TermBuilder, TermBuilder> termBuilder)
    {
        _term.Append(" * ");
        var term = new TermBuilder();
        termBuilder(term);
        _term.Append(term.Build());
        return this;
    }

    // Method to return the constructed term
    public string Build()
    {
        return _term.ToString();
    }
}

public class FactorBuilder
{
    private StringBuilder _factor;

    // Constructor initializes the StringBuilder to hold the factor
    public FactorBuilder()
    {
        _factor = new StringBuilder();
    }

    // Adds a number to the factor, suitable for method chaining
    public FactorBuilder Number(int number)
    {
        _factor.Append(number);
        return this;
    }

    // Adds an expression inside parentheses, allowing for nested recursive expressions
    public FactorBuilder Expression(Func<ExpressionBuilder, ExpressionBuilder> exprBuilder)
    {
        _factor.Append("(");
        var expr = new ExpressionBuilder();
        exprBuilder(expr);
        _factor.Append(expr.Build());
        _factor.Append(")");
        return this;
    }

    // Method to return the constructed factor
    public string Build()
    {
        return _factor.ToString();
    }
}

// Example usage:
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var expression = new ExpressionBuilder()
            .Term(term => term
                .Factor(factor => factor.Number(5))
                .Multiply(term => term
                    .Factor(factor => factor.Number(3))))
            .Plus(expr => expr
                .Term(term => term
                    .Factor(factor => factor.Expression(innerExpr => innerExpr
                        .Term(t => t.Factor(f => f.Number(2)))))))
            .Build();

        Console.WriteLine(expression); // Output: 5 * 3 + (2)
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Fluent API Design for Chaining**:
   - Each method (`Term`, `Plus`, `Multiply`, `Factor`, etc.) returns an instance of the class itself (`this`) to allow chaining.
   - Each part of the grammar (`Expression`, `Term`, `Factor`) is represented as a different builder class.

2. **Recursive Constructs via Nested Lambdas**:
   - **Nested Functions**: When there's a need for recursion (e.g., expressions within parentheses), a nested lambda (`Func<T, T>`) is used to represent this recursive part of the DSL.
   - **Usage Example**: In `FactorBuilder`, the `Expression` method accepts a lambda to represent an inner expression. This allows the fluent DSL to specify nested expressions naturally, which can go as deep as needed.

3. **Separation of Builders**:
   - The hierarchy of builders (`ExpressionBuilder`, `TermBuilder`, `FactorBuilder`) follows the grammar rules:
     - **`ExpressionBuilder`** handles high-level expressions and uses `Plus`.
     - **`TermBuilder`** handles terms and operations like multiplication.
     - **`FactorBuilder`** handles numbers and grouped expressions (using parentheses).

4. **User Example**:
   - The example usage constructs `5 * 3 + (2)` by:
     - **Term**: Constructs `5 * 3` using chaining.
     - **Plus**: Adds `+` followed by a nested expression.
     - **Factor Expression**: Adds `(2)` as a nested expression using the lambda construct.

### Key Features of This Approach:

- **Method Chaining**: Keeps most of the grammar constructs in a fluent API style, which allows users to build DSL expressions conveniently without needing to break the chain.
- **Recursive Construction with Lambdas**: Uses lambdas for recursive parts where expressions can contain other expressions, allowing users to intuitively handle recursive constructs.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each builder class has a clear responsibility, corresponding to different parts of the grammar.
- **Flexibility**: The combination of chaining and lambda-based recursion provides flexibility to support a broad range of grammar rules while keeping the syntax readable.

### Benefits:

- **Readable and Natural API**: The chaining approach provides a natural DSL that reads like a series of operations, and the recursive parts do not break this fluency.
- **Maintainable Code**: By using separate builder classes, it's easier to maintain and extend the DSL grammar.
- **Handles Complex Expressions**: The recursive lambda functions allow for complex nested expressions without losing clarity.

This approach ensures that method chaining is prioritized, making the DSL easy to use while retaining flexibility with nested functions for recursion. The fluent interface keeps the code clean and readable, which is ideal for designing DSLs where users will often need to build complex expressions.
