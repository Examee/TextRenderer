Below is a high-level overview (with code snippets) of how you might approach creating and managing a memory pool in C# for storing data of various types without incurring boxing overhead. It covers some of the fundamental ideas: using generics, handling different types, using unsafe constructs or `Memory<T>`, pinning vs. non-pinning, etc. The approach you ultimately choose depends heavily on how you access the data (random vs. sequential), performance constraints, memory usage, and complexity.

## 1. The Problem: Storing Heterogeneous Data Without Boxing

By default, in C#:

- **Value types** (structs, built-in numeric types, etc.) are typically allocated inline, but assigning them to variables of type `object` will box them.
- **Reference types** (classes) are always allocated on the heap, and references are stored in variables.

When you say “store multiple types without boxing,” the typical challenge is that if you create a container (e.g., an `object[]`), any value type you put in that array will be boxed. Similarly, using an interface-based approach (e.g., `IList<object>`) also induces boxing of value types. 

### Why Boxing Occurs

Boxing is the process of converting a value type to an object reference in C#. When you do something like:

```csharp
int x = 123;
object o = x;  // Boxing happens here
```

This allocates memory for an `int` on the heap. In high-performance contexts or when writing a memory pool, you want to avoid boxing because it:

1. Incurs additional heap allocations.  
2. Causes more frequent garbage collections.
3. Adds overhead of copying the value type into the object “box.”

Hence, the goal is to store the **native** representation of different value types without converting them to objects.

---

## 2. Approaches to Avoid Boxing

### A. Use Generics (Parameterize by Type)

One straightforward approach to store data without boxing is to use a *generic* pool, parameterized by `T`. For instance:

```csharp
public class Pool<T> where T : struct
{
    private T[] _items;
    private int _index;

    public Pool(int capacity)
    {
        _items = new T[capacity];
        _index = -1;
    }

    public bool TryGet(out T item)
    {
        if (_index < 0)
        {
            item = default;
            return false;
        }

        item = _items[_index--];
        return true;
    }

    public bool TryReturn(T item)
    {
        if (_index >= _items.Length - 1)
        {
            return false;
        }

        _items[++_index] = item;
        return true;
    }
}
```

- This pool only stores a **single** type `T` at a time—no boxing occurs because `T` is a value type and we’re using an array of `T`.  
- You can instantiate different pools for different types: `Pool<int>`, `Pool<float>`, etc.  
- But if you need a **single** data structure to hold multiple types all at once, you need to approach the problem differently.

### B. Discriminated Union or “Tagged” Structs

If you need to store multiple possible types in a single pool, you can create a “tagged union” like so:

```csharp
public enum ValueTypeTag
{
    None,
    Int32,
    Float,
    Double,
    // Add more as needed
}

[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)]
public struct ValueUnion
{
    [FieldOffset(0)] public ValueTypeTag Tag;

    [FieldOffset(4)] public int IntValue;
    [FieldOffset(4)] public float FloatValue;
    [FieldOffset(4)] public double DoubleValue;
    
    // Add more fields if needed
}

public class HeterogeneousPool
{
    private ValueUnion[] _items;
    private int _index;

    public HeterogeneousPool(int capacity)
    {
        _items = new ValueUnion[capacity];
        _index = -1;
    }

    public bool TryGet(out ValueUnion item)
    {
        if (_index < 0)
        {
            item = default;
            return false;
        }

        item = _items[_index--];
        return true;
    }

    public bool TryReturn(ValueUnion item)
    {
        if (_index >= _items.Length - 1)
        {
            return false;
        }

        _items[++_index] = item;
        return true;
    }
}
```

Here:

1. You keep a tag (`ValueTypeTag`) describing the active type.  
2. You manually interpret which union field to access based on that tag.  
3. Because `ValueUnion` is a struct, you avoid boxing.  
4. Memory usage is determined by the largest field in the union (in this example, a `double` might be largest).  
5. You have to be careful to set and check the `Tag` so you know which field is valid.

This is a common pattern in lower-level languages (like C) and also possible in C# with `[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)]`. It’s quite manual, but it’s boxing-free.

### C. Unsafe Pool With Raw Memory (Advanced)

If you want a chunk of raw memory that you manage yourself, you can do so with **unsafe** code. You’d allocate a pinned array or use a native heap allocation (via `Marshal.AllocHGlobal`), then slice it up as needed. For example:

```csharp
public unsafe class UnsafeMemoryPool
{
    private byte* _buffer;
    private int _capacity;
    private int _offset;

    public UnsafeMemoryPool(int capacity)
    {
        _capacity = capacity;
        // Allocate pinned or unmanaged memory:
        _buffer = (byte*)Marshal.AllocHGlobal(capacity).ToPointer();
        _offset = 0;
    }

    public T* Allocate<T>() where T : unmanaged
    {
        // Check we have space for size of T
        int sizeOfT = sizeof(T);
        if (_offset + sizeOfT > _capacity)
        {
            throw new OutOfMemoryException("Pool is exhausted");
        }

        T* ptr = (T*)(_buffer + _offset);
        _offset += sizeOfT;
        return ptr;
    }

    public void Free()
    {
        if (_buffer != null)
        {
            Marshal.FreeHGlobal((IntPtr)_buffer);
            _buffer = null;
        }
    }
}
```

Then you can do something like:

```csharp
public void ExampleUsage()
{
    UnsafeMemoryPool pool = new UnsafeMemoryPool(1024);

    int* myIntPtr = pool.Allocate<int>();
    *myIntPtr = 123; // Store value

    float* myFloatPtr = pool.Allocate<float>();
    *myFloatPtr = 3.14f;

    // No boxing: direct memory write

    // When done:
    pool.Free();
}
```

**Pros:**

- Total control over memory layout.  
- Zero boxing.  
- Potentially very fast if done carefully.  

**Cons:**

- You must manage alignment, lifetime, and “recycling” space yourself.  
- Risk of memory corruption, unsafe code, pinned memory fragmentation, etc.  
- Not typical “managed” C# usage, so you lose some benefits of the runtime.

### D. Using `ArrayPool<T>` From `System.Buffers`

If your main goal is to pool arrays of a **specific type** (e.g., `int[]`, `byte[]`, etc.) without frequent allocations, the built-in `ArrayPool<T>` can help:

```csharp
var pool = ArrayPool<byte>.Shared;
byte[] rented = pool.Rent(1024);

try
{
    // Use array without boxing
}
finally
{
    pool.Return(rented);
}
```

However, this still only pools arrays of *one type at a time*. It’s not a single data structure that can hold multiple different types. Also, it doesn’t store elements heterogeneously in the same array; you get a separate array for each usage.

## 3. Selecting the Right Strategy

### If You Only Need One Type Per Pool

- **Use a generic approach:** `Pool<T>` with an internal `T[]`.
- No boxing if `T` is a struct.
- Very straightforward.

### If You Need Multiple Types in the Same Pool

- **Use a tagged union** approach (manual “discriminated union”).  
- Or store different typed arrays in the same class but keep them separate (i.e., parallel arrays).  
- Or use a more advanced unsafe approach for maximum flexibility.

### If You Need High Control Over Memory Layout

- **Use unsafe code** to allocate and manage raw memory. This is similar to what you might do in C/C++ if you need a custom allocator or memory arena.  
- This can be efficient but is more complex and error-prone.

## 4. Practical Tips to Avoid Boxing

1. **Use Structs With Generics**  
   Generics with `struct` constraints will store them inline in arrays or local variables, without boxing.

2. **Be Wary of Interfaces**  
   If you cast a struct to an interface, you can incur boxing. For example:
   ```csharp
   public interface IFoo { }
   public struct MyStruct : IFoo { }

   IFoo foo = new MyStruct(); // This can cause boxing
   ```
   There are *some* exceptions under the covers (e.g., with C# 7.3+ and certain `in` parameters), but generally be aware that interfaces + structs often means boxing.

3. **Avoid Using `object`**  
   Storing a struct in an `object[]` or returning it as an `object` will box. If you have an array of `object`, you’ll inevitably box.

4. **Leverage the BCL**  
   The .NET standard library has `Span<T>`, `Memory<T>`, `ArrayPool<T>`, etc. If you can structure your problem such that you only need arrays of a single type, you can get a lot of benefits without reinventing the wheel.

5. **Testing and Benchmarks**  
   Always benchmark real usage scenarios to confirm that your approach is significantly faster or more memory-efficient than simpler alternatives. Sometimes a simpler solution with a small overhead is still fast enough, and the complexity of manual memory management is unnecessary.

---

## Summary

To build a memory pool that handles **multiple types** without **boxing**, your primary options are:

1. **Tagged unions** to store heterogeneous data in a single container.  
2. **Multiple specialized pools** (one per type) using generics.  
3. **Unsafe memory management** for ultimate control.

Each approach avoids boxing but offers different trade-offs between flexibility, memory usage, code complexity, and maintainability. In many scenarios, a well-structured approach (like generics + separate pools for each type) strikes the best balance of performance and code clarity. If you truly need a single container for arbitrary types, the tagged union or unsafe approach may be more suitable.
